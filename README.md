# plotly_deployment

## Project Overview
An interactive dashboard was created to allow users to explore belly button biodiversity data by research study participant.  Javascript was used to manipulate the json data provided and to add interactivity elements with event handlers.  Bootstrap was leveraged for styling and layout formatting, and Plotly was used to build the interactive charts on the dashboard.


## Interacting with the Dashboard
On the upper left hand side of the page is a drop-down box where the user can select a specific study participant.  Once a new participant id is selected all the charts and demographics information is updated to reflect the selected partipant's data.

## Customizations to the Original Dashboard
A few edits were made to improve upon the original challenge dashboard.
- in place of the plain gray jumbotron a partial image of microscopic art by Martin Oeggerli was added
- the text in the selection box was centered and the color of the font was changed to orange to bring more attention to the selection box which was hiding in plain sight in the previous version
- the html code was updated to leverage bootstrap functionality to make the page mobile responsive
